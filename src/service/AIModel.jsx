Check recent reviews and availability on booking sites before confirming.  Prices can fluctuate.  I focused on hotels in relatively central locations for easier access to attractions.\n*   *Itinerary Structure:*  Each day is divided into morning, afternoon, and evening activities.  This provides a framework, but you can adjust it based on your preferences and pace.\n*   *Transportation:* Local trains are the cheapest option, but they can be crowded, especially during peak hours.  Taxis and auto-rickshaws are more convenient but more expensive.  Ride-sharing apps are a good alternative.  Factor in travel time, as Mumbai traffic can be heavy.\n*   *Food:*  I've highlighted opportunities to try local street food.  Be mindful of hygiene.
